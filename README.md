### Hello!

I'm Peter, I work for [Cyted](https://cyted.ai). I like building cool and useful technology while sometimes looking at surreal memes and complaining about old tech.

- I like functional programming
- I also like [Rust](https://rust-lang.org)
- Databases are fun

These things make my life easier and help me build better and more useful apps and technology. I promise I'm not as boring as this README makes me sound. If you want, you can look at [my personal website](https://peterea.st).
